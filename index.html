                on transferred to Three Bells primary in Kibera where I sat for my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in 2015.
                Afterwards I joined Archbishop Njenga Girls High school in Western. This was a journey indeed!I managed to study there for 
                my four year course of high school completement in 2019.

           <h3>Why I decided to take a class on <strong>programming;</strong></h3>
           <p>Ever since in high school I decided to choose Computer studies as a subject since it was an optional subject.As time went by 
               I realized my undying passion about technology in general.In form three there was a topic about programming though it was not 
               that widely explained but I had alot of interest in knowing more about programming.After my comlpletion in high school,i wanted
               to go to a school that offers programming course but I did not have the funds to do that.Later on,my friend reffered me to Moringa
               school and thankfully I got a chance to study there.Programming has alot of benefits,you can get a really nice job after comlpletion
               of the course and the pay is quite encouraging and then you get to gain more skills in relation to the field.
