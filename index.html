                class two then later on went to Our Lady Of Mercy primary in south c, in Our Lady of Mercy studied upto class six then later 
                on transferred to Three Bells primary in Kibera where I sat for my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in 2015.
                Afterwards I joined Archbishop Njenga Girls High school in Western. This was a journey indeed!I managed to study there for 
                my four year course of high school and completed in 2019.

           <h3>Why I decided to take a class on <strong>programming;</strong></h3>
           <p>Ever since in high school I decided to choose Computer studies as a subject since it was an optional subject.As time went by 
               I realized my undying passion about technology in general.In form three there was a topic about programming though it was not 
               that widely explained but I had alot of interest in knowing more about programming.After my comlpletion in high school,i wanted
               to go to a school that offers programming course but I did not have the funds to do that.Later on,my friend reffered me to Moringa
               school and thankfully I got a chance to study there.Programming has alot of benefits,you can get a really nice job after comlpletion
               of the course and the pay is quite encouraging and then you get to gain more skills in relation to the field.
